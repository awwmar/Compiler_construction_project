1. Introduction
This project implements the lexical and syntax analysis phases for the CS F363 language.

2. Lexical Analysis
- Removes comments (%) and normalizes whitespace.
- Produces tokens as per Table 1 in the specification.
- Reports lexical errors for malformed tokens like <--, 23.4, &&.

3. Syntax Analysis
- Uses LL(1)-compatible grammar.
- Recursive-descent parsing with precedence for arithmetic expressions.
- Handles statements, declarations, function calls, if/while, return.

4. Grammar Fixes
- Eliminated left recursion in expressions.
- Added operator precedence and associativity.
- Left-factored conditional statements.
- Treated RUID (#name) as type reference.

5. Assumptions
- No semantic checks.
- Grammar acceptance only.
